                        of law, the remaining provisions of these Terms shall remain in effect. These Terms constitute

                    <p>The Company's failure to enforce any term or condition in these Terms shall not be considered as
                        a waiver of that term or condition, or any other term or condition. Moreover, if the Company
                        fails to assert any right or provision under these Terms, it does not constitute a waiver of
                        that right or provision.</p>

                    <p>If any provision of these Terms is found by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction
                        to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be limited or eliminated to the
                        minimum extent necessary so that the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue to be
                        valid and enforceable.</p>
